# Story Statistics

Programming 2 2019 spring practical work (moved to GitHub from another version control system after finishing)

This program was created by two Finnish students as their practical work for a Finnish programming course and thus its documentation and code are in Finnish. This version, however, has a completely English UI for non-Finnish people.

There are no plans to translate the documentation at the moment.
