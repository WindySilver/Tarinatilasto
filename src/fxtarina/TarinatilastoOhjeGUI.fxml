Double-clicking the story's series's name opens a window with which you can change the story's series.&#10;Editing options can be found from the Edit menu.&#10;- The object to be edited needs to be selected, otherwise editing options will do nothing!&#10;The stories are shown on the left side by the selected series. Choose another series to see other stories.&#10;If changes do not show, click the story on the list again so that the changes become visible. Behind this, just like the first found story becoming selected only randomly while searching, is a bug that we haven't been able to fix.&#10;Windows: The save files' folder is found in the folder where you launched Story Statistics. If you did not give a folder, the files can be found from the launching folder.&#10;Linux: The save files are found in the folder you gave while launching Story Statistics or in some other folder if you did not give a folder or the whole location.&#10;- Testing on Ubuntu 18.04 put the files into the home folder when Story Statistics was run from a subfolder of the home folder (that is, /home/user/subfolder)&#10;You can make your own save files to any folder by giving the folder's name and, on Linux, also its location.&#10;- A new folder is created automatically if a folder with the given name and location isn't found, and new files are created on the first save if they're not found.&#10;Important note! For cross-language compatibility, the file names haven't been changed for the translations.&#10;File name translations:&#10;Sarjat = Series&#10;Tarinat = Stories&#10;Osat = Parts" wrapText="true" BorderPane.alignment="CENTER">
